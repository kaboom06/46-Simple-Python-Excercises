The function max()from exercise 1) and the function
max_of_three()from exercise 2) will only work for
two and three numbers, respectively. But
suppose we have a much larger number of numbers,
or suppose we cannot tell in advance how many
they are? Write a function max_in_list()that takes a
list of numbers and returns the largest one

def maximum(list_var):
    return max(list_var)
print(maximum([32,43,2,3,45,6,43]))

In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to \"snap out of it\" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC</td>\n",

When I work with those that are experiencing concerns related to feeling of depression and issues with self esteem.

CBT helps with gaining a better awareness of how your thought process influences your belief system, and how your beliefs impact your actions and the outcome of your behaviors.  This process isn’t easy but it helps teach an individual that we don’t always have control over what happens in our lives but we can control how we interpret, feel, and behave. CBT is good for individuals dealing with depression, anxiety, toxic relationships, stress, self esteem, codependency, etc.</td>\n",

              "1  Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to \"snap out of it\" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC   \n",

I'd look at finding what is going well in your life and what you can be grateful for. I believe everyone has talents and wants to find their purpose in life. I think you can figure it out with some help.   \n",

When I work with those that are experiencing concerns related to feeling of depression and issues with self esteem. I generally work with my client to help build coping skills to reduce level of depression and to assist with strengthening  self esteem, by guiding my client with CBT practices. CBT helps with gaining a better awareness of how your thought process influences your belief system, and how your beliefs impact your actions and the outcome of your behaviors.  This process isn’t easy but it helps teach an individual that we don’t always have control over what happens in our lives but we can control how we interpret, feel, and behave. CBT is good for individuals dealing with depression, anxiety, toxic relationships, stress, self esteem, codependency, etc.   \n",

You can always make yourself available to learning new things or volunteering so that you can make a purpose for yourself.   \n",

        "There's a little more preprocessing we need to do however! We want to keep our phrases relatively short; however, some of the questions and answers in our dataset are several sentences long.\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve this problem, we'll split up each question and each answer into their constituent sentences. We'll then pair the first sentence of the question with the first sentence of the answer, the second sentence of the question with the second sentence of the answer, and so on until we can't form any more pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, suppose we have the following question-answer pair:\n",
        "> **Q**: \"I am not feeling well today. I feel sad.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "> **A**: \"Tell me more about how you feel. What have you been up to today?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we would split up the question into its constituent sentences, resulting in `[\"I am not feeling well today.\", \"I feel sad.\"]`. Similarly, we would split up the answer into its constituent sentences, resulting in `[\"Tell me more about how you feel.\", \"What have you been up to today?\"]`. Finally, we would pair each sentence of the question with its corresponding sentence of the answer, ultimately resulting in two separate question-answer pairs:\n",
        "> **Q**: \"I am not feeling well today.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "> **A**: \"Tell me more about how you feel.\"\n",

        "Congrats! Today, you've built an even better chatbot, one that's powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. Hopefully you can see that our chatbot is looking a little bit more and more like the chatbots and voice assistants that we take for granted today, such as Alexa and Echo. You've learned about the key technologies that have driven modern chatbots; most of the current cutting-edge work in language generation and in chatbots is some improvement on the programs that you've learned about today. In our next notebook, we'll look at even more cutting-edge machine learning techniques in order to make our chatbots perform better, while also tying back our chatbot to our question of mental health and thinking about how well our chatbots would work in that context. Till next time!"

        "\n",
        "Regular RNNs suffer from what's called a \"vanishing gradient\". What does this mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you gave an RNN two sentences with blanks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. \"I loved traveling to France, where the weather was lovely and the food was extraordinary. I particularly enjoyed exploring the capital city of ____.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. \"I'm a person who just really enjoys traveling and trying all the good food around the world. The capital of France is _____.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Which one do you think a typical RNN would do better at predicting?\n",
        "\n",
        "A typical RNN would do better with sentence (2) than sentence (1).\n",
        "\n",
        "Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "So here, the correct word for each of the blanks is \"Paris\", the capital of France. The key bit of information that you would've needed to see was the word \"France\". However, in sentence (1), France is in the beginning of the string, and the blank is at the end, while in sentence (2), France is near the blank. \n",
        "\n",
        "Typical RNNs place more weight on more recent information when trying to predict, say, what comes next. Functionally, this makes sense, since it's often likely that the information that helps predict what word comes next is probably the words that came just before it. However, there are definitely instances where we want our program to, say, remember what came up much earlier in a long conversation, and typical RNNs can't do that too well.\n",

        "![link](http://images.memes.com/meme/721858)\n",
        "\n",

        "LSTMs and GRUs are two similar models which are both modifications of RNNs that were designed to get around this problem. Below is a structure of an LSTM cell, which is the \"fundamental unit\" of an LSTM (similar to how the fundamental unit of a neural network is the neuron).\n",

        "![link](https://i.stack.imgur.com/voZql.jpg)\n",
        "\n",
        "The key takeaway here is that LSTMs can selectively \"choose\" what things to remember and what things to forget. \n",
        "\n",
        "Typical RNNs have one \"hidden unit\", which keeps track of, for example, what was said earlier in a sentence. However, this hidden unit can be heavily influenced by what it's seen more recently, and so things that were seen earlier in the sequence become \"forgotten\" as the RNN gets further along in a sentence (because as the RNN gets further along into a sentence, it \"writes over\" older information to make room for new information)\n",
        "\n",
        "For example: \n",
        "\n",
        "\"I loved traveling to France, where the weather was lovely and the food was extraordinary. I particularly enjoyed exploring the capital city of ____.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "By the time that an RNN gets to the end of this, it's already forgotten that the word \"France\" exists. It's not quite sure which words to treat as important so it's going to default by assuming that words which are later in the sequence are more important than those earlier in the sequence. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, an LSTM can \"choose\" what it remembers and what it forgets. For example, in the sequence: \n",
        "\n",
        "\"I loved traveling to France, where the weather was lovely and the food was extraordinary. I particularly enjoyed exploring the capital city of ____.\"\n",
        "\n",

        "• \"I loved travelng to\"\n",
        "\n",
        "• \"I loved traveling to France\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Intuitively, at each step, an LSTM can look at the new word and ask \"how important is it that I remember this piece of information?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when the LSTM sees this: \n",
        "\n",
        "• \"I loved traveling to France\"\n",

        "\n",
        "We want a program where a person can ask a question, of any given length, and our program will be able to understand it. One thing to consider is that in mental health, it's common for people to say, upfront, what's bothering them (e.g., anxiety), and then to go on and talk about what they've been going through recently. We want our program to be robust enough so that, as people talk with our chatbot, the chatbot won't forget the main topic of conversaton (e.g, \"this person is feeling anxious\")"
